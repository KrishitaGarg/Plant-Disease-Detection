## ðŸš€ Features

- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop or browse files (JPG, JPEG, PNG) with up to 200MB size.
- **Disease Classification**: Predicts plant health or disease status with precise labels (e.g., "Tomato - Target Spot").
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and responsive web interface for seamless user experience.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The model is trained on the PlantVillage Dataset, a publicly available dataset hosted on Kaggle. It contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, covering a wide variety of crops and diseases. This comprehensive dataset ensures the model's high accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸŒŸ How It Works

1. **Upload** a clear image of a plant leaf.
2. **Classify**: The model processes the image and predicts its health or disease status.
3. **Result**: Get instant feedback with the plant type and health update.
